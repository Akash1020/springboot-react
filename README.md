# React + Springboot + MySQL
This project is an integration of Springboot, MySQL database and React app. Material-UI has also been used for beautification.

Tech Stack
================
React for Frontend | Springboot for Middleware (Spring Data REST JPA) | MySQL for Backend

Project Title
==============
React with Spring Boot

Description
====================
* UI is a react app making ajax call to API using Fetch. 
* API is a spring boot REST API fetching data from a MySQL database table through JPA repository.

Developed Using
===================
* React - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* Material-UI - A set of React components that implement Google's Material Design specification because we want things to be pretty
* Maven - Dependency Management
* ES6 – The next version of JavaScript. Allows us to write real JavaScript classes.
* JSX – Allows us to place HTML in JavaScript without concatenating strings.
* Typescript (TSC) - To transpile our ES6 and TSX (or JSX) into ES5 and Javascript
* Webpack – Allows us to pack all of our JavaScript files into one bundle
* Springboot - RESTful Spring Boot Microservices with Spring Data JPA (Spring Data REST)
* Hibernate - JPA provider
* MySQL - Database

Prerequisites
=================
* Install node 
* Install npm 
* Install Java (jdk 1.8 is preferred)
* Install Maven 3.x
* Install Eclipse or Spring Tool Suite
* Install Visual Studio Code

Notes
============
 * I created this React app using <code>create-react-app</code>. In the case of create-react-app, you can either install it globally (i.e. <code> $ npm install -g create-react-app </code>) or install it locally (i.e. <code>$ npm install create-react-app </code>). If you choose the latter, you will have to specify its path whenever you invoke it (e.g. path/to/node_modules/.bin/create-react-app). 
 
 * Check Installed Versions
 
    Node: <code>$ node --version
    v8.9.4 </code>
              
    NPM: <code>$ npm  --version
    5.6.0</code>
              
    Create React App: <code>$ create-react-app  --version 
    1.5.2</code>
 

Quick Start Development
============
* git clone https://github.com/RatneshChauhan/Springboot-React-Typescript-Material-UI-MySQL.git
* Imported as maven project in eclipse or sts. Run springboot application on embedded Tomcat. 
* Restore database:
  Create my_customer_db named database on the target machine and run:
  mysql -u root -p my_customer_db <path-to-db_backup>\db_backup.sql to restore the backup
* Run npm start in VSCode
* Hit http://localhost:3000/
* You can now view my-react-app-with-typescript in the browser proxying request /api/customer/all from http://localhost:3000 to http://localhost:8080/
