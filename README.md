# React + Springboot + MySQL
This project is an integration of Springboot, MySQL database and React app. Material-UI has also been used for beautification.

JWT for Authentication and Authorization  
===========================================
On successful login, clinet recieves a JWT token included 'Authorization' header from server and sets that token up in the local storage. On subsequent requests, this token has been sent back to server as an 'Authorization' header and validated for authorization.On logout this token is removed from local storage. 

Login Credentials
=========================
username: admin

password: password

Description
====================
* UI is a react app in Typescript making ajax call to REST API using Fetch. 
* API is a spring boot REST API fetching data from a MySQL database table through JPA (Hibernate) repository.

Developed Using
===================
<pre>
* React - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* Material-UI - A set of React components that implement Google's Material Design specification because we want things to be pretty
* Maven - Dependency Management
* ES6 – The next version of JavaScript. Allows us to write real JavaScript classes.
* JSX – Allows us to place HTML in JavaScript without concatenating strings.
* Typescript (TSC) - To transpile our ES6 and TSX (or JSX) into ES5 and Javascript
* Webpack – Allows us to pack all of our JavaScript files into one bundle
* Springboot - RESTful Spring Boot Microservices with Spring Data JPA (Spring Data REST)
* Hibernate - JPA provider
* MySQL - Database
* JWT – For token based user authentication and authorization
</pre>

Prerequisites
=================
<pre>
* Install node 
* Install npm 
* Install Java (jdk 1.8 is preferred)
* Install Maven 3.x
* Install Eclipse or Spring Tool Suite
* Install Visual Studio Code
</pre>
Notes
============
 * I created this React app using <code>create-react-app</code>. In the case of create-react-app, you can either install it globally (i.e. <code> $ npm install -g create-react-app </code>) or install it locally (i.e. <code>$ npm install create-react-app </code>). If you choose the latter, you will have to specify its path whenever you invoke it (e.g. path/to/node_modules/.bin/create-react-app). 
 
 * Check Installed Versions
 
    Node: <code>$ node --version
    v8.9.4 </code>
              
    NPM: <code>$ npm  --version
    5.6.0</code>
              
    Create React App: <code>$ create-react-app  --version 
    1.5.2</code>
 

Quick Development Setup
=======================
<pre>
* git clone https://github.com/RatneshChauhan/Springboot-React-Typescript-Material-UI-MySQL.git
* Imported as maven project in eclipse or sts. Run springboot application on embedded Tomcat. 
* Restore database:
  Create my_customer_db named database on the target machine and run:
  mysql -u root -p my_customer_db <path-to-db_backup>\db_backup.sql to restore the backup
* Run npm install and then npm start in VSCode command line
* Hit http://localhost:3000/
* You can now view my-react-app-with-typescript in the browser proxying request /api/customer/all from http://localhost:3000 to          http://localhost:8080/ 
</pre> 

Versioning
======================
<pre>
* Node: 8.9.4
* NPM:  5.6.0
* Create React App: 1.5.2
* Spring Boot: 1.5.10.RELEASE
* React: 16.2.0
* Material-UI: 0.20.0
* Maven:
</pre>
Deployment
======================

* API

<pre>Run <code>mvn clean install</code> to generate a WAR file deployable in any servlet containers like Tomcat, Jboss, Websphere etc. </pre>

* UI

<pre>Run <code>npm run build</code></pre>
 
 It builds the app for production to the build folder.
 It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
 The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
 Your app is ready to be deployed! 
 

 </pre>
 
Static Server Deployment
========================
For environments using Node, the easiest way to deploy it would be to install serve and let it handle the rest:
<pre>
npm install -g serve
<code>serve -s build
</pre>
The last command shown above will serve your static site on the port 5000. Like many of serve’s internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the -p or --port flags.

Other Deployment Methods
======================
* You don’t necessarily need a static server in order to run a Create React App project in production. It works just as fine integrated into an existing dynamic one like Node with Express.
* The choice of your server software isn’t important either. Since Create React App is completely platform-agnostic, there’s no need to explicitly use Node.

The build folder with static assets is the only output produced by Create React App. Set up your favorite HTTP server (Tomcat, Jboss or whatever..) and copy this build folder so that a visitor to your site is served index.html, and requests to static  paths like /static/js/main.<hash>.js are served with the contents of the /static/js/main.<hash>.js file.
 
However this is not quite enough if you use client-side routing.
